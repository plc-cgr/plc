# Step 1
step1.header=This is a complicated process. You will go through three sections.
step1.first=First
step1.second=Second
step1.third=Third
step1.first.text=You'll interact with the core ideas of informed consent for the Sage Commons.
step1.second.text=You'll read the informed consent agreement, and digitally sign it.
step1.third.text=You'll be able to start participating in public genomics research by uploading data.
step1.submit=I understand, and want to proceed

#Step 3
step3.conditions=We will impose the following conditions on researchers through
step3.termsOfUse=Terms of Use
step3.termsOfUse.remainder=, which either must be visible on the website that hosts your data or must be digitally signed by those who access your data.
step3.reidentify=Do not attempt to
step3.reidentify.remainder=re-identify me
step3.dontharm=Don't harm me
step3.share=Share your research
step3.share.remainder=from my data with the public under open access terms
step3.limits=However, there are limits to the power of Terms of Use, and there are no guarantees that users will respect all of these conditions. Please make sure to watch the entire video in the following stage of the consent process - it is vital that you understand these considerations if you are going to provide informed consent and participate in public genomics research.
step3.submit=I understand
step3.yourRequests=Your Requests
step3.yourRequests.text=By signing up for the Portable Consent process, you're signing up for a system that is a 'commons' - meaning that while you've granted some rights in the previous phase of the consent process, you're going to reserve some rights as well. These are behaviors you can request, and they'll be implemented via 'terms of use' - a contract that researchers will have to sign to gain access to the system. You can read more about the terms of use below.
step3.reidentification=Re-identification
step3.reidentification.text=We are quickly learning that with powerful computers and good mathematicians, it is increasingly possible to uniquely identify people inside large data sets. This is done every day with social media and in the 'app' universe of phones, indeed, your personal data is the engine that powers the finances of the modern Web in many cases. Preventing re-identification is often one of the major goals of informed consent in its traditional context. Re-identification means that someone figures out that a given genotype or' health record in the CGR system is actually yours, and connects it to your name, your email, or another piece of data that directly identifies you. Researchers will sign a contract in which they agree that, even if they were able to identify you, they won't do it.
step3.harmPrevention=Harm Prevention
step3.harmPrevention.text=Harm prevention is another major goal of informed consent systems. It's one of the primary reasons we have so much fragmented data. There are a lot of imagined - and real - harms for public or commonly available genomic data. Someone could use information from your health and genomic backgrounds to infer paternity or other features of your family history, make claims that could affect your employment, insurance, or other financial services, incriminate relatives, make and place synthetic DNA as evidence, or reveal propensity for a disease that has no treatment. Researchers will sign a contract in which they agree that, even if they were in position to harm you, such as working at an insurance company, they won't do it.
step3.sharing=Sharing Research
step3.sharing.text=Since most research is published in scholarly journals, and most journals aren't available to the broader public due to cost and copyright concerns, researchers will have to commit to making their published research available under the Reproducible Research Standard. This means that the article itself must be 'Open Access' - online, free of charge, and free of most copyright restrictions. It also means that any software and data that is needed to replicate or build on the research described in the article is also online, free of charge, and free of most copyright restrictions. This means you'll be able to read the article, and that others who might want to build on the research will be able to do so as well.
step3.termsOfUse.text=Terms of use are the rules of the CGR system. They are embedded into a contract that researchers have to sign to access your data. These rules are legally binding on the researcher who signs them. If you've used sites like eBay or PayPal, you've used a website that uses terms of use to create community trust. If a researcher violates the terms of use, we will not only terminate their account, we'll name them publicly and make sure they don't come back.


#Step 4
step4.rights=These are the rights you are granting to
step4.rights.remainder=qualified researchers
step4.rightTo=Right to
step4.doResearch=do research
step4.withMyData=with my data
step4.redistribute=redistribute
step4.myData=my data
step4.publish=publish the results of research
step4.fromMyData=from my data
step4.commercialize=commercialize products derived from research
step4.onMyData=on my data
step4.allBoxes=All boxes must be checked to move forward in the consent process
step4.submit=Next
step4.qualifiedResearchers=Qualified Researchers
step4.qualifiedResearchers.text=Researchers who qualify to access the data you share will have gone through a process to make sure they're real people - not the kind of software robots that create spam in your mailbox - and will have signed a contract in which they commit not to identify you, not to harm you, and not to give your data to anyone else who hasn't signed the same terms. This is a low barrier of qualification, because we want a wide variety of researchers using Common Genomic Research data. We'll explain the risks later in this process, because it's important you understand them. By setting this barrier low, we increase the number of researchers, but we can always raise it if we - and you - decide it's necessary.
step4.rightToResearch=Right to Research
step4.rightToResearch.text=Research is a broad term. It can mean anything from poking around inside data sets to see what clicks to using data in a large-scale, corporate clinical trial. Basically we are defining research as the use of your data to figure things out about biology, health, and more. It's about asking questions that are driven by data, or using data to formulate new questions. It's also about adding new data - new bits of information, what are often called annotations - that adds context to your data and makes it more useful in the assembly of data into knowledge. Research does not include the sale of your data as a product itself - your data will be free of charge in the CGR system, always, including to you.
step4.rightToRedistribute=Right to Redistribute
step4.rightToRedistribute.text=Data is easy to redistribute once it's in an online database, just like other forms of digital content such as music or ebooks. Controls on redistribution are complex, difficult to implement, expensive, and often fail to work (or at best, only work on nice people, not those who actively mean to get copies no matter what). Thus we are not implementing complex controls on redistribution, and indeed we are going to allow redistribution under a certain set of circumstances. A qualified researcher who accesses your data will have the right to redistribute it, but only to someone who has signed up to the terms of the system: don't re-identify people, don't do harm to people, publish results openly, and in turn, don't redistribute to someone who hasn't signed up for the same deal. We won't have the power to actively punish those who violate, but we will kick them out of the entire system and name them publicly. Violation of the terms will be a professional sin akin to plagiarism, which although not a legal crime, is an incredibly powerful control in its own right.
step4.rightToPublish=Right to Publish
step4.rightToPublish.text=Most traditional researchers are looking to make discoveries that they can publish in scholarly journals. This is a method of knowledge dissemination that is hundreds of years old, and one that is deeply enabled by the internet. We're simply making sure that this right to publish is explicit - that you know about it, and that researchers know about it. However, there is a twist - all those publications have to be made available for you, and the world, to read under 'Open Access' terms. You'll learn more about that in the next part of the process.
step4.rightToCommercialize=Right to Commercialize
step4.rightToCommercialize.text=One of the main reasons we're doing this is that we don't have enough products in health care - new therapies and medicines, new diagnostics, software tools that help us stay healthy, and more. Our explicit goal is to turn Common Genomic Research into the basis for new product discovery. This means that you are granting the right to researchers who make discoveries to turn them into products, without an expectation that you'll personally profit back from those products. Products are anything that can come out of your data: drugs, diagnostics, software apps, hardware, and more. Products are not your data itself. Your data is free, and always will be.

step5.video.url=https://player.vimeo.com/video/37704392?api=1&player_id=ctrvideo&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0
step5.mustWatchVideoCompletely=You must watch the video through in its entirety.
step5.mustWatchVideo=You must finish watching the video to advance in the consent process.
step5.submit=Next

#Step 6
step6.dontKnowEnough=If you don't feel like you know enough about public genetic research to move forward, or are uncomfortable now that you know, this is a good time to stop.

step6.backToPublicGenetics=Please take me to resources on public genetics
step6.backToBioethics=Please take me to resources on bioethics and informed consent
step6.submit=I understand, and want to proceed

#Step 7
step7.affirmCheckboxes=Tell us that you understand this informed consent process.
step7.affirmUncertainty=I have read about
step7.affirmUncertainty.remainder=the uncertainty and risk of this research.
step7.affirmConsent=I provide
step7.affirmConsent.remainder=for my data to be used in research.
step7.affirmWithdrawlPolicy=I understand that although I can
step7.withdraw=withdraw
step7.affirmWithdrawlPolicy.remainder=at any time, I cannot withdraw data that has
step7.affirmWithdrawlPolicy.remainder2=already been distributed
step7.allBoxes=All boxes must be checked to create informed consent.
step7.submit=I want to give consent
step7.uncertaintyAndRisk=Uncertainty and Risk
step7.uncertaintyAndRisk.text=The risks of public disclosure of your genetic and trait data, including your DNA sequence data, or other information you provide, could affect the employment, insurance and financial well-being or social interactions of you and your immediate family. The video you just watched, and the consent form, go through a long, but by necessity non-comprehensive, list of those risks. It's not comprehensive because we simply cannot imagine all the possible risks - they will change over time, and we do not have an infinite imagination. You should be prepared for these risks, and be willing to balance them against the benefit to scientific research of sharing. If you're not, please do not move forward to the next phase of the process.The Personal Genome Project perhaps summarizes the risks most succintly: in principle, someone could use information from your health and genomic backgrounds to infer paternity or other features of your family history, make claims that could affect your employment, insurance, or other financial services, incriminate relatives, make and place synthetic DNA as evidence, or reveal propensity for a disease that has no treatment. Please read carefully into Article VI of the consent form to see the detailed list provided there.
step7.providingConsent=Providing Consent
step7.providingConsent.text=Consent means that you are providing a legally binding agreement that data you choose to upload will be available under Portable Legal Consent for distribution under the Common Genomics Research framework. Please do not digitally sign the consent form in the next phase if you do not wish to provide consent, or if you do not understand the ideas you have encountered in the process so far.
step7.withdrawing=Withdrawing
step7.withdrawing.text=It is possible to withdraw once you have provided consent. You would need to either contact the Common Genomics Research entity to which you uploaded your data and ask them to delete your data and notify those who have harvested it to delete your data, or to contact the harvesters of the data directly and ask them to delete your data. If you are contacting the harvesters, remember that they do not have your email or name, so you'll need to provide your Sage Bionetworks Common Identifier for them to know which record is yours and delete it. However, withdrawal and deletion of data may be of limited impact if that data has already been distributed to other parties under the Common Genomics Research framework.
step7.withdrawingData=Withdrawing Data
step7.withdrawingData.text=Once any data or information about you is posted to the CGR public database, other organizations and individuals may acquire copies of it. There will be no way to ensure that they will delete their copies of your data or information, or for Sage Bionetworks Common Genomic Research Project or the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework to even know what copies of your data or information may exist. Both Sage Bionetworks Common Genomic Research Project and the CGR entity who runs an instance of the Consent framework will encourage researchers and other users to use the most current version of the CGR public database, but your data may be combined by Sage Bionetworks Common Genomic Research Project and/or its collaborators or other third parties in ways that will make it impossible to delete them from such datasets.

step8.informedConsentIncludes.li3=Asking questions to the investigator or staff about anything that is not clear, and
step8.informedConsentIncludes.li4=Printing out an unsigned copy of this consent form.  This gives you time to think about it and to talk to family or friends before you make your decision.
step8.thingsToKnowBefore=You should not join this research study until all of your questions are answered. Things to know before deciding to take part in a research study
step8.thingsToKnowBefore.li1=The main goal of a research study is to learn things to help patients in the future.
step8.thingsToKnowBefore.li2=The main goal of regular medical care is to help each patient.
step8.thingsToKnowBefore.li3=The decision to join or not join the research study will not cause you to lose any medical benefits. If you decide not to take part in this study, your doctor will continue to treat you.
step8.thingsToKnowBefore.li4=After going through the online materials and reading the consent form you should understand the goals of the research study and the risks of taking part in the study.
step8.thingsToKnowBefore.li5=Any data you contribute such as personal genomic or health data or your medical records may become part of the research record. If that happens, your data and medical records will be looked at and/or copied by the sponsor of this study and government agencies or other groups associated with the study.
step8.purposeOfStudy=Purpose of the Study
step8.purposeOfStudy.li1=Traditionally, most scientific research involves selected individuals who volunteer time, contribute samples and data in the name of improving our collective understanding and small groups of researchers who analyze that data and publish their findings in scientific literature. Once the project is over, it's over, and re-using the data is hard to do.
step8.purposeOfStudy.li2=The purpose of this study is to create a far larger group of participants, to make it far easier to re-use the data again and again, and to allow any volunteer to play an active role in the scientific research process. The study is possible through technical and legal tools that permit participants to broadly share and distribute their data for research purposes, and tools that make it easy for researchers to use your data to improve our common understanding of human genomics and health.
step8.purposeOfStudy.li3=The experimental components of this study are
step8.purposeOfStudy.li3.li1=The completion of mixed- media information modules and an online informed consent process.
step8.purposeOfStudy.li3.li2=The provision of personal, genomic and health-related information
step8.purposeOfStudy.li3.li3=The broad availability of the collected datasets to any interested researcher who have explicitly agreed to the study's terms and conditions.
step8.purposeOfStudy.li4=One of the primary aims of the CGR is to build large, open datasets and tools that make it easy for scientists to work together and innovate by utilizing health data. While we believe that promoting public research is crucial to the rapid advancement of scientific and medical knowledge, we also recognize that it carries a unique set of risks and considerations for participants. This document is designed to help you understand those risks and to make an informed choice about whether to participate in Creating a Citizen-contributed Genomic data cohort/ PLC-CGR
step8.procedures=Procedures
step8.procedures.li1=Sage Bionetworks is conducting a study that will collect genomic, phenotypic, observational, health-related and other forms of information from volunteer individuals
step8.procedures.li2=The information will be owned by the individuals (i.e., already in their possession) and uploaded by electronic means, including websites and software applications.
step8.procedures.li3=The information will be provided by the individuals to the study, and not generated by the study investigators.
step8.procedures.li4=To respect participant's privacy, unless otherwise requested, information that can directly identify the participant will be removed from the data prior to making it available to researchers. Information that can directly identify participants are
step8.procedures.li4.li1=Names;
step8.procedures.li4.li2=All geographical subdivisions smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code, if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.
step8.procedures.li4.li3=All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older;
step8.procedures.li4.li4=Phone numbers;
step8.procedures.li4.li5=Fax numbers;

step8.procedures.li4.li9=Health plan beneficiary numbers;
step8.procedures.li4.li10=Account numbers;
step8.procedures.li4.li11=Certificate/license numbers;
step8.procedures.li4.li12=Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers;
step8.procedures.li4.li13=Device identifiers and serial numbers;
step8.procedures.li4.li14=Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs);
step8.procedures.li4.li15=Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers;
step8.procedures.li4.li16=Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints;
step8.procedures.li4.li17=Full face photographic images and any comparable images; and
step8.procedures.li4.li18=Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code (note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data)
step8.procedures.li4.li19=However, even with removal of these identifying information points, it is sometimes possible to re-identify individuals uniquely given enough information about the individual. This risk should be contemplated prior to enrolling.
step8.procedures.li5=Individuals will be assigned a "global unique identifier" (GUID) that will be published alongside their data. The GUID will allow for new data that participants upload to be connected to their old data, or for data that is uploaded from multiple venues to be connected. The GUID will also serve as a mechanism for researchers to send messages to participants without having to reveal the identities of participants.
step8.procedures.li6=Data collected will be made available, for research purposes, to a broad variety of users who have agreed to be bound by a contract and to specific terms and conditions that include use of the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm, not re-identify or re-contact individuals, and to make their research results openly available to the general public.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts=Risks and Discomforts
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.top=The main risk of donating your personal, genetic and health-related information is the loss of confidentiality. The following is a non-comprehensive list of scenarios that could pose risks for you and/or your family
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li1=Data that you provide (such as trait data or DNA sequence or other genetic data) may be used to identify you. This may, among other things, result in contact from the press and other members of the public motivated by positive or negative feelings about one or more studies. This could mean a significant loss of privacy and personal time.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li2=If you enroll in the creation of a Citizen-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort, it is possible that data not intended to be published (e.g., your name, date of birth, or contact information) will be publicly disclosed due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study, or may be used for unauthorized purposes despite the restrictions that those using data are required to agree to. Should this occur you would be subject to the various risks and discomforts described in this section and throughout this consent form, and possibly to other risks as well, even though you did not intend for such data to be published or misused
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li3=The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could cause you to learn - either directly, from a family member or from another individual - certain unexpected genealogical features about you and/or your family. In particular, you might learn things about your genetic features that might cast doubt on paternity in your family.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li4=The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to reveal to you or a member of your family the possibility of a disease or other trait or propensity for a disease or other trait.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li5=The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to claim statistical evidence, including with respect to your genetic predisposition to certain diseases or other traits, that could affect the ability of you and/or your family to obtain or maintain employment, insurance or financial services (for example, "your genotype indicates you have a statistically higher probability of prostate cancer, and thus life insurance premiums increase);
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li6=Whether or not it is lawful to do so, you could be subject to actual or attempted employment, insurance, financial, or other forms of discrimination or negative treatment due to the public disclosure of your genetic and trait information through this study or by a third party. Although United States law bars certain forms of genetic discrimination (the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, also known as GINA), this law does not apply to the use of genetic information in all circumstances and, even where it does apply, it does not guarantee that your genetic information will not be used against you in a way that you feel is discriminatory or otherwise harmful to you and/or your family.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li7=If you have previously made available or intend to make available genetic or other medical or trait information in a confidential setting, for example in another research study, the data that you provide to the Citizen-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort may be used, on its own or in combination with your previously shared data, to identify you as a participant in otherwise private and/or confidential research. This means that any data or other information you may have shared pursuant to a promise of confidentiality or privacy may become public despite your intent that they be kept private and confidential. This could result in certain adverse effects for you, including ones not considered or anticipated by this consent form.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li8=Your commonly available DNA sequence data, trait data and other information will include certain information that applies to your family members. Some people may draw conclusions from your commonly available information, including speculating about what such information might reveal about you and your family members. As a result, we cannot predict all of the risks, or the severity of the risks, that the public availability of this information may pose to you and your relatives. You are strongly encouraged to discuss your participation in this study and its potential risks, including the fact that not all of the risks are known, with your immediate family members.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li9=There are some risks that are currently very unlikely, but at least theoretically possible, from sharing your DNA sequence information online. For example, someone could synthesize strings of DNA from your data and place them at a crime scene in an attempt to implicate you.
step8.risksAndDiscomforts.li10=Individuals under the age of 21 will not be allowed to participate in the study.
step8.newInformation=New Information
step8.website=Participants will be informed via the study website at
step8.website.name=http://weconsent.us
step8.website.url=http://weconsent.us
step8.website.remainder=about any new information that might change their decision to continue to be in this study. You may be asked to sign a new consent form if this occurs.
step8.benefits=Benefits
step8.benefits.p1=You are not likely to directly benefit in any way as a result of your participation in the creation of a Citizen-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort. The benefits will primarily be to society and to science at large.
step8.benefits.p2=The primary outputs of this study will be published, either in the traditional scientific literature or in newer forms such as blogs, wikis, software models of disease, and more. One of the Terms of Use that we will require of researchers is a commitment to publish their results under "Open Access" terms, which means that the outputs must be freely available on the public internet, permitting any users - including you - to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. This is not a direct benefit to you, but to science and society, but through this Open Access requirement you will at least be able to access and read the research emerging from the study without having to pay fees.
step8.benefits.p3=This study does not entitle you to demand data return from a biosample you submit in the context of other clinical research, or of data from another study.
